# Hi, I'm Andrius

I'm a beginner QA automation learner focused on **test automation, Python, and web technologies**. I’m actively building real-world projects to apply what I learn and gain hands-on experience with industry-relevant tools and practices. My main goal is to transition into a role in **QA automation** or **Python-based scripting/automation**, where I can contribute to building reliable and efficient testing solutions. I’m currently learning best practices in automated testing, exploring frameworks like **pytest** and **Selenium**, and gradually improving my understanding of software quality, version control, and CI/CD workflows.

## About Me
- Learning **automated software testing** using:
  - `Python`, `pytest`, `Selenium`, and Page Object Model (POM)
- Studying QA theory (test levels, types, bug lifecycle, test design techniques)
- Learning `Git`, version control workflow.

## Tech Skills
**Programming:**  
- Python (automation, scripting, data processing)

**Testing:**  
- Manual testing basics (test cases, bug reports, testing levels)
- Automated testing with `pytest`, `Selenium`, `POM`
- Working with data: `pandas`, `openpyxl`

**Tools & Workflow:**  
- Git & GitHub – version control and collaboration
- PyCharm – Python development environment
- File system automation: `os`, `shutil`, `glob`
- JIRA – task and bug tracking
- Qase – test case management and execution

 ## Goals

- Land a job in QA automation or Python scripting
- Improve test design and automation frameworks
- Learn API testing, advanced pytest, and test reporting
- Build and share practical automation projects
